### 🧠 About Me

I research **how deep learning models think**. 

With a strong mathematical foundation, I focus on opening the "black box" of Transformers to understand their internal reasoning. Beyond theory, I love building robust, scalable AI systems that solve actual problems.

Currently pursuing my **MS in Data Science and AI** at IIT Madras, working on Transformer Interpretability under Prof. Harish Guruprasad.
